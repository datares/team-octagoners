# Data
The data used to develop our Medium article came from: [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/mdabbert/ultimate-ufc-dataset) and [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_UFC_events). 

The Wikipedia dataset contained data pertaining to each UFC event including the venue, location and attendance for each event. This data stretches from the inception of the UFC in 1993 to present day. We used this in combination with the larger and more detailed Kaggle dataset, which contained 4558 observations and 137 columns. The Kaggle dataset has a variety of data for each fight and for each fighter ranging from 2010 to present, allowing for a large variety of data analysis. The variables in this dataset ranged from player's info such as their wins, losses, and so on, as well as fight specific details such as average significant strikes, average submission attemps, and average takedown attempts. 


# Data Processing 

# Analysis and Code 
Our analysis was split between data visualizations and machine learning models.

### Visualizations
We looked at various aspects of the UFC, including the UFC's growth in the past years, specific fighters' data, and general UFC wide trends. Considering that the UFC is divided into weight classes, we decided to look at how fights vary between weight classes. We also looked at how 

### Machine Learning
Given the large number of variables our dataset contained, we realized that we could create machine learning models to predict the winner of a fight. We used a variety of models, including logistic regression, K-nearest neighbors, random forest, decision trees, support vector machine, and neural network.
