# Data
The data used to develop our Medium article came from: [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/mdabbert/ultimate-ufc-dataset) and [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_UFC_events). 

Give some background about the data here. When was the data set created? What year(s) was the data from the data set from? How many variables were in it?

The Wikipedia dataset contained data pertaining to each UFC event including the venue, location and attendance for each event. We used this in combinatino with the larger and more thorough Kaggle dataset, which contained 4558 observations and 137 columns. The Kaggle dataset had a variety of data for each fight and for each fighter, allowing for a large variety of data analysis.

# Data Processing 

# Analysis and Code 
Our analysis was split between data visualizations and machine learning models.

### Visualizations

### Machine Learning
Given the large number of variables our dataset contained, we realized that we could create machine learning models to predict the winner of a fight. We used a variety of models, including logistic regression, K-nearest neighbors, random forest, decision trees, support vector machine, and neural network.
